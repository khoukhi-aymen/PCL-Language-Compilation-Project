# PCL Language Compilation Project with FLEX and BISON Tools

The aim of this project is to develop a mini-compiler that goes through various compilation phases, including lexical analysis using the FLEX tool and syntax-semantics analysis using the BISON tool. Intermediate code generation, optimization, as well as machine code generation, will be implemented in the C language. Parallel processing for symbol table management and handling of different errors should also be implemented during the compilation process analysis phases.
